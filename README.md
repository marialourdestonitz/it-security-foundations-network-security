Key Terms for IT Security Fpoundarions: Network Security

Key Terms:
•	Access Control List (ACL): A list of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a particular object or system resource
•	Advanced threat management: Devices that have additional features such as AI, and reputation-based monitoring to defend against threats that use known and unknown attack vectors
•	Egress filtering: Prevents certain packets from leaving the network
•	Firewall: A hardware or software-based method to control incoming and outgoing traffic and is based on a set of rules that either permit or deny traffic on a network or host 
•	Hardware firewalls: Firewalls that prevent unauthorized network access by filtering traffic and can provide varying levels of protection and performance
•	High-end hardware firewalls: Dedicated appliances that provide enhanced performance and protect the edge and critical infrastructure environments without reducing network performance
•	Honeypot: A system set up to lure a would-be attacker, to observe their behavior
•	Ingress filtering: Prevents attack packets such as malware from entering the protected network
•	Intrusion detection and prevention systems: Sensors that monitor ingress and egress traffic using deep packet inspection and a combination of signature and heuristic-based analysis for unusual or suspicious data or activities
•	Intrusion detection system: A device that sits out-of-band and passively monitors network traffic for malicious activity; if detected, it will log information about the activity and report an attack
•	Intrusion prevention system: A device that sits in-band and actively monitors network traffic for malicious activity; if detected, it blocks the attack and logs information about the activity
•	Personal firewalls: Software firewalls are used on laptops or desktops that support stateful inspection and network address translation, and allow users to set rules for specific applications
•	Proxy server: A web server that acts as a gateway between a client application, for example, a browser and the real server
•	Router firewall: A physical device controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and uses network address translation to mask private IP addresses
•	Unified threat management (UTM): Next-generation firewalls that combine firewall capabilities with intrusion prevention, antivirus, antispyware, data loss prevention, and content filtering features
